Compute jovian eclipses, write up results to stack, say "confirm by
looking at target, not from Jupiter"

Ask Stellarium to show Jovian lunar eclipses incl one moon eclipses another

If partial solar eclipse on moon from earth, that part of moon
receives less sunlight = what does earth see if anything (thought:
moon still looks fine because even a sliver of sunlight is enough to
"fully" illuminate moon?)

look more into straight line cutting into sun and moon if moon is small enough

(note: could use this data to compute actual times)

TODO: maybe one day post-edit stream titles for what was done vs what
I planned to do?

This is not not a list of possible future streams
=================================================

  - can i install grav-sim on VM (can't on regular)

  - WTF is quantum computing?

  - how does Stellarium compute magnitude (Lambertian reflectors?) +
  port to CSPICE

  - multi calendar project

  - nagyerass tests writing (in particular, push to git reminder)

  - bc-rename-bad-files.pl (since convmv failing)

  - convert skyfield constellation determination to CSPICE (or just
  use my own?)

  - elliptical orbits using (not) Mathics

  - parallel editable comments to git structure

  - categorize jokes and annoy people on reddit project?

  - steal guys idea (and SimEarth idea) of using Stefan-Boltzmann law
  to determine temperature?

  - create stream buffer on stream (or do I want to use streamelements
  cause I want it going before VM is live?) (but could create on
  stream and use off stream?)

  - vblog all the crap I wanted to write up and maybe write it up at
  the same time

  - cool KML/non-KML maps stream?

  - "moon enters sextans" has only 4 google results

  - youtube/twitch/dl confirmation matches

  - what Earth data do I have (landuse/cover/pop density/animals/etc)

  - how fast does the Sun's shadow move (w/ disclaimers vastly larger
  than answer)

  - petition IAU: no more constellations? (change.org?)

  - xkcd: comment on dumb/bad strips?

  - go thru my email (carefully)

  - write prog to see how effective insulin is (assuming same activity)?

  - port note to bcgit?

  - put large pages on github pages so google will index them? (broken
  up nicely)

  - WTF is Cameron San Francisco?

  - https://github.com/Overv/WebCraft and other minecraft?

  - set up google page for "SEO" to show how its done + track github
  pages? (new acct or use existing?)

  - convert subtitles.txt file to SRT format (youtube scraping)

  - neural network in action watch

  - pbs3.referata.com

  - post subtitles of my streams in a zillion languages and get google to index them (do I need special encoding to say "this page is in stupid language X?"

TODO: Sun was in CET and ORI year +-10000, do something with this

TO FIX xclock:

xclock -digital -update 1 -strftime "%Y%m%d.%H%M%S UTC" &

some constellation garbage: 

22 zodiac signs http://lulu.com/astrology 16 ascendants 67 horoscope signs 1008 planets 16 Sun signs Cartesian house system RTRRT future-changing 22 There are 22 zodiacal stations, also known as the Academic Zodiac; which is the sum of all main planetary zodiacs plus lunar. 16 At the current epoch, we observe 16 ascendants rising at east. CAVEAT These are NOT ascendants: Aries, Gemini, Cancer, Libra, Scorpius, Sagittarius and Capricornus.
