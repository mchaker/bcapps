Stuff I plan to stream 15 Dec 2019, primarily for my reference

Transfer umbral cone stuff to CSPICE

Fix discussion from yesterday re umbral cone extension

test against known solar/lunar eclipses (but I use sphere, so approx only)

Compute jovian eclipses, write up results to stack, say "confirm by
looking at target, not from Jupiter"

Ask Stellarium to show Jovian lunar eclipses incl one moon eclipses another
