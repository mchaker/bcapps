This is not an answer, but I've written a very basic proof-of-concept page at https://barrycarter.github.io/pages/HELIACAL/ which computes the heliacal rising and setting(as well as dawn/dusk rising/setting) for stars at any right ascension and declination, and for cities at any latitude and longitude. You can also select from a list of big cities and bright stars. Note that the longitude field is not actually used and does not affect the computation. Notes:

  - The dates given should be very accurate for the year 2020, but less accurate further from 2020.

  - I used precession-corrected positions for the Sun, but J2000 positions for the stars, but the inaccuracy thus generated should be very small.

  - The code does account for refraction, the sun's angular radius, and the Equation of Time (more details below).

  - Source code: https://github.com/barrycarter/pages/tree/master/HELIACAL

  - The source code is in JavaScript, and all files you need to run it are in the source code above. The code is entirely client-side and does not make any server connections. If you download it, you should be able to run it even without an Internet connection.

  - I livestreamed my attempts to solve this problem. The recordings are available at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQiTKaefaTLpfUVJETwWX31IxLypqA7xy (videos 81-87 with 'heliacal' in the title). However, there are several highly off-topic digressions, and, even when I stay on-topic, the process of watching me work out this answer may not be helpful.

  - I included dawn/dusk rising/setting because even bright stars may not be visible when the sun is rising or setting, but should be visible when the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon (start/end of civil twilight).

  - Stars rise about 4 minutes earlier every day. This means that:

    - The heliacal dates are only approximations, and a star might rise/set/etc +-2 minutes (in some cases more) from when the Sun does.

    - Stars rise with the sun before they rise at dawn; realistically, this means a given star will be first visible in the morning sometime between it's heliacal rise and it's dawn rise.

    - Conversely, a star may be visible at dusk ("first star I see tonight") one day, and not be visible at all the next day.

  - I originally tried to use a simple closed-form formula for solar right ascension and declination:

`ra = 2*Pi*d/365.242`

`dec = 23.4*Pi/180 * sin(ra)`

where `ra` is the right ascension, `dec` is the declination, `365.242` is the length of the tropical year, `23.4` is the inclination of the ecliptic in degrees (converted to radians via multiplying by `Pi/180`), and `d` is the number of days since the vernal equinox.

Unfortunately, because this formula completely ignores the Equation of Time (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time), it was excessively inaccurate when I used Stellarium to check my results.

I ended up using CSPICE to generate solar positions and Mathematica to create an interpolation good to within 5 seconds of arc: https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/tree/master/ASTRO/bc-approx-sun-ra-dec.m

  - I was hoping to find a closed-form formula for heliacal rising date, but, even ignoring refraction, the sun's angular radius, and the Equation of Time, I couldn't find such a formula, even with the free Wolfram Cloud's (https://www.wolframcloud.com/) help.

  - I still believe there may be a closed-form approximation that does not require iterative searching like my current solution does. I believe that graphing the "heliacal rising date" function (which has three inputs: right ascension, declination, and latitude) might help find that closed-form approximation.








below this line: not using this time

  - I was hoping to find a closed-form solution, but the geometric rise time of a celestial object above a given altitude is:

$
\text{ra}-\text{ArcCos}\left[-\text{Tan}\left[\text{dec}\right] \text{Tan}\left[\text{lat}\right]+\frac{\text{Sin}\left[\text{alt}\right]}{\text{Cos}\left[\text{dec}\right] \text{Cos}\left[\text{lat}\right]}\right]
$

where `lat` is the observer's latitude, `dec` is the celestial object's declination, `alt` is the given altitude above the horizon, and `ra` is the celestial object's right ascension.

When `alt` is 0 (the geometric rise over the horizon), the formula simplifies to (per https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/14492/need-simple-equation-for-rise-transit-and-set-time):

$
\text{ra}-\text{ArcCos}\left[-\text{Tan}\left[\text{dec}\right] \text{Tan}\left[\text{lat}\right]\right]
$

The simplified formula is inaccurate, however, because it doesn't account for refraction (standard value of 34 minutes at the horizon) and the sun's angular radius (16 minutes of arc).


stars ra rising and setting time are fixed

, assuming the sun's right ascension increased linearly over the year, and the declination was the tilt of the ecliptic times the sin of the number of days since
