TODO:

moon names like "Worm Moon"

https://nationaldaycalendar.com/calendar-at-a-glance/ (but possibly
companies can "buy into" this, not a "real" calendar)

https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/congressional-record-index/114th-congress/2nd-session/special-days-and-holidays/234037
(and previous Congresses or find list of observances somewhere)

ping gcal folks on making holiday lists more complete

Draconids not listed in SKYCAL (astro) calendar, and maybe other
meteor showers as well

Mercury transit of 2016 may 09 wasnt listed (added it as special case), figure out why + add others?

World Series is no longer held at regularly scheduled time?, fix dates

wikidata holidays in usa

Friday the 13ths?

URL (google calendar can't use, but others can?)

snap.nal.usda.gov/nutrition-through-seasons/holiday-observances (as
different calendar, but perhaps use some events in main calendar?)

Emoji/unicode as event symbols

Carnival (in Rio de Janiero)

Comic Con/other non-regularly shceduled events

Super Tuesday, party-specific conventions

Coachella, Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, glastonbury?, woodstock?, other
music festivals?

Sundance, Tribeca, SXSW, other film festivals?

Mohammed's birthday (gcal does not appear to list this)

Chinese New Years (gcal has an odd version of this)

starts of sports seasons, hockey, baseball, basketball, etc

"Chinese NY (Rooster)" is too wide for bc-calendar.pl, but won't be an
issue until ~2017

"Quadrantids (120/hr)" and "Moon-Antares: 2.1<B0> S" same issue;
latter won't be a problem until 2022, which is suspicious actually
