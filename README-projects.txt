Title: GAIM-ify (not gamify) or Pidgin-ify the console

Description: I use GAIM (Pidgin) for a variety of accounts, but it
would be nice if I could access the console from GAIM, particularly
since I could use command-line clients directly from Pidgin. This
shouldn't be hard to do, since Pidgin already connects to IRC and it
seems you could just hack around to get this to work.

Code URL: none

downloads their ad but never displays it to you, making it much harder
for them to tell you are blocking their ads.

  actor/character has w/o watching the movie/show]

  - GAIA2 star catalog in 3D

  - triangle dissection/shapes in general

  - game on real world map

  - most files in my git that are not answers to questions relate to
  some project
