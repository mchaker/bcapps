# Another "useful only to me" program (although you can make it useful
# to you by using bc-parse-qfx.pl, MySQL, and categorizing your
# expenses), this program tells me how much I am spending on various
# things, my cash flow, etc.

# This program gets most of its info from command line options

# --income=amount: income per month

# --fixed=cat1=val1,cat2=val2,cat3=val3: treat category spending as
# fixed per month

# --extra=name1=amt1,name2=amt2,name3=amt3,...: extra money I have (or
# owe if negative) that doesn't appear in my databases (the names are
# cosmetic ways of tagging these amounts)

# --exclcat=cat1,cat2,cat3,...: exclude categories from consideration (eg,
# refunded transactions, transactions that move money from one account
# to another, categories that I no longer use + expect no future
# charges for, etc)

# --exclbank=bank1,bank2,bank3,...: exclude these banks from consideration

# --exclcard=card1,card2,card3,...: exclude these credit card from
# consideration

# --start=date: how far back to go when making calculations (default =
# look at all categorized transactions)
