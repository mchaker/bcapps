The file jupiter-gallilean-eclipses.txt.bz2 contains a list of all lunar eclipses from 1850 to 2100 (as viewed from Jupiter) of Jupiter's four largest moons (also known as the "Galilean moons"): Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto.

Explanation of columns:

The first column is the NAIF id of the moon being eclipsed:

  - 501 = Io
  - 502 = Europa
  - 503 = Ganymede
  - 504 = Callisto

The second column is the NAIF id of which source of light is being
eclipsed. In our case, this is always 10 for the Sun.

The third column is the NAIF id of the body causing the eclipse. In
our case, this is always 599 = Jupiter.

The fourth column indicates whether an eclipse is starting or ending:

  - P+ = a partial lunar eclipse is starting
  - P- = a partial lunar eclipse is ending
  - T+ = a total lunar eclipse is starting
  - T- = a total lunar eclipse is ending

The values "CP+", "CP-", "CT+", "CT-" are used for sanity testing and
can be safely ignored.

The fifth column indicates the ephemeris time a given event
occurs. You will generally want to use the time in the sixth column
which is given as yyyymmdd.hhhmmss

TODO: explain "C." values better w DISCLAIMER
