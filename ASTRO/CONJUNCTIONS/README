This directory contains the output of ../bc-planet-conjuncts.c run on
various subsets of planets. The filenames represent which planets are
in conjunction, with each number standing for one planet:

1: Mercury
2: Venus
4: Mars
5: Jupiter
6: Saturn
7: Uranus

These numbers follow the official NAIF IDs in ../naif_ids.html

Inside the files (which are bzip2 compressed), lines starting with "R"
represent the Julian day range where the planets are within 6 degrees
of each other. For example, the line:

R 1122664.638620 1122672.220301

in 147.bz2 means that the 3 planets Mercury (1), Mars (4), and Uranus
(7) are within 6 degrees of each other between Julian days
1122664.638620 and 1122672.220301

The following line:

M 1121948.064577 2.183128 13.429573

means:

  - The minimum separation occurs at Julian day 1121948.064577

  - The minimum separation is 2.183128 degrees

  - The minimum distance betgween the Sun and any of the 3 planets is
  13.429573 degrees
