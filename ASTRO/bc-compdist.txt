Short answer: the Earth is closer to the Sun than to Mars about 77.9% of the time.

## Methodology ##

I wrote https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/tree/master/ASTRO/bc-compdist.c to compute when and how long Mars was further from the Earth than the Sun. In the ~30,000 year period covered by DE431, this happens 14,231 times for an average duration of 607.93 days, followed by an average of 172.00 days where Mars is closer. Notes:

  - The actual duration Mars is further varies from 546.55 days to 648.41 days.

  - The duration between when Mars is further away varies from 760.96 days to 814.51 days. The Earth-Mars sydonic period is 779.9 days.

  - Both variances above can be explained by the eccentricity of Mars' orbit. As noted in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_Mars#Close_approaches_to_Earth the Earth-Mars distance when the Sun-Earth-Mars are lined up varies considerably, so the time it takes Mars to get further than the Sun varies considerably.

  - I livestreamed my solving this problem and the videos are available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2gmWhW0QZY&list=PLQiTKaefaTLpfUVJETwWX31IxLypqA7xy with the titles "Earth-Sun-Mars distances".
