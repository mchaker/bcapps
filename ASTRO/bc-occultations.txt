This doesn't really answer your question, but may be helpful. I may also add more to this answer later.

I computed all eclipses of Jupiter's four largest moons (subject to the caveats below), and the results are in the compressed text file "jupiter-gallilean-eclipses.txt.bz2" in the "https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/tree/master/ASTRO/" directory, with a README at "README.jupiter-gallilean-eclipses" in the same directory.

## Caveats ##

I assumed that a total lunar eclipse means that there is no sunlight falling on the moon, and the moon is completely dark. It's theoretically possible that there is sunlight somewhere on the moon, but that sunny portion of the moon is not visible from Jupiter. However, since Jupiter is the object causing the eclipse, I don't this ever actually happens.

Similarly, I assume a partial lunar eclipse means that there is no sunlight on at least one part of the moon that would normally have sunlight (ie, is facing towards the sun),

I assumed all objects were spheres. This is essentially true for the Sun and Jupiter's four largest moons, but not for Jupiter itself. I used Jupiter's equatorial radius (possibly a bad idea) as the radius for my theoretical Jupiter sphere.

I ignored the effects of Jupiter's atmosphere, if any. For Earth, the atmosphere must be taken into consideration as noted "https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OHres/LEshadow.html". Without this correction, the total (Earth) lunar eclipse of 26 May 2021 (https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEplot/LEplot2001/LE2021May26T.pdf) would only be a partial eclipse.

I did not consider the possibility of one of Jupiter's moons eclipsing another. I haven't checked, but I believe no moon can cast a shadow large enough to totally eclipse another moon.

I ignore penumbral eclipses. A penumbral eclipse occurs when the sun is *partially* obstructed for a portion of the moon. In other words, observers on the moon see a partial solar eclipse, but not a total solar eclipse. Penumbral eclipses are hard to see even on Earth as noted on https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/what-is-a-penumbral-eclipse-of-the-moon

<blockquote>
During a penumbral eclipse, very observant people in the right spot on
Earth will look up and notice a dark shading on the moonâ€™s
face. Others will look and notice nothing at all.
</blockquote>

I used a 60 second window in the CSPICE library (https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/), so I might have missed eclipses lasting less than one minute.

Columns:

  - The first column shows the name and NAIF id of the moon

  - The second column shows the number of total eclipses from 1850 to 2099 inclusive. Of course, all total eclipses start as partial eclipses.

  - The third column is simply the second column divided by 250 years.

  - The fourth through sixth columns give the duration of the shortest, mean, and longest total eclipses. Time spent in partial eclipses is not included.

  - The seventh column indicates what percentage of time the moon spends eclipsed.

Notes:

  - Unfortunately, you cannot simply add the eclipse times to find when at least one moon is eclipsed, because the eclipses may overlap.

  - For Io, Europa, and Ganymede, all partial eclipses become total eclipses.

  - For Callisto, there are 267 partial eclipses that do not become total.

  - Although NASA provides planetary system barycenter positions ~+-15000 years from now, it only provides positions for Jupiter's Galilean (and technically for Jupiter itself) moons from 1850-2099. More details can be found in the '.cmt' files at https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/satellites/

## How to crosscheck my results ##

Recent versions of Stellarium (including 0.19.0) will display Jovian lunar eclipses. Older versions will show the moon's magnitude (as viewed from Jupiter) increasing (ie, the moon gets dimmer) during an eclipse, but not the actual eclipse itself.

By default, Stellarium uses VSOP to compute planetary positions, so the results might disagree with mine slightly. Stellarium can use SPICE kernel files (which are fairly large) as an option for better crosschecking.

Because Jovian lunar eclipses are visible everywhere, including on Earth, there is some interest in tracking them: https://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/a-jupiter-almanac/

However, the listed times in these almanacs are for viewers on Earth, whereas my times are for viewers on Jupiter. Since Jupiter is several light hours away, the times listed in the almanac will be several hours later that the times I list.

Additionally, the almanac may not list the same events as I do. For example, if a moon falls into Jupiter's shadow (total eclipse of the moon) then goes behind Jupiter (as viewed from Earth), the almanac may not list the end time for the eclipse, since the moon would remain non-visible until it came out from behind Jupiter.

## Jupiter's other moons ##

Jupiter has a total of 79 moons (https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/joviansatfact.html), excluding the 23 fragments of Shoemaker Levy 9, which were only moons for two years (https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/FORTRAN/req/naif_ids.html#Comet%20Shoemaker%20Levy%209)

Unfortunately, I did not use my program on the non-Galilean moons because:

  - My program assumes all objects are spheres, and moons like Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe are highly non-spherical.

  - Most of Jupiter's other moons are very small would be difficult to see from Jupiter even if they were not eclipsed.

  - In theory, I could've use CSPICE's gfoclt() function (https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/gfoclt_c.html) to find when a theoretical observer at the center of these moons witnesses a total eclipse, but this would be less accurate. However, I *may* still this for Metis to answer https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/34426/how-long-do-solar-eclipses-last-on-metis since solar eclipses on Metis are equivalent to lunar eclipses of Metis as viewed from Jupiter.

  - There are other, more precise methods I could use, but they are computationally expensive.

## Code ##

The code I used to make these calculations:

  - https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/tree/master/ASTRO/bc-occultations.c (generates results)
  - https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/tree/master/ASTRO/bc-parse-jovian-lunar-eclipses.pl (parses results)
  - https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/tree/master/ASTRO/bc-spice-occultations.c (only used for sanity checking)

Subject: Can gfoclt() find eclipses on the surfaces of bodies?

*****NAME OF GUY********,

Thanks again for all of your previous help with CSPICE.

While reading the documentation examples for gfoclt_c() at
https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/gfoclt_c.html#Examples
I noticed that it says:

"Find occultations of the Sun by the Moon (that is, solar eclipses) as
seen from the *center* of the Earth over the month December, 2001"
[emphasis added]

However, just to clarify, this function won't necessarily find
eclipses on the *surface* of the Earth, is that correct?

I noticed that both the back body and the front body can be modelled
as triaxial ellipsoids, but the target must be a single point.

Is there a better way to find eclipses on the surface of bodies,
instead of at a central point?

I tried writing a penUmbralData() function that does this:

https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/master/ASTRO/bclib.h#L728

but it only works if all three bodies are spherical (I also realize
this should be bclib.c not bclib.h), and it's not super accurate.

Subject: Is lunar eclipse of 26 May 2021 really total?

[[[ATTACH!!!!]]]

********NAME*******,

While trying to write a function that computes eclipses on surfaces of
bodies, I ran into an unusual situation: it appears that the lunar
eclipse of 26 May 2021 is not quite total, unless I'm misunderstanding
the definition of total eclipse.

More specifically, if you're at the lunar north pole at the time of
greatest eclipse (2021-05-26 11:18:04.3 UTC), a small portion of the
Sun is still visible, at least according to Stellarium (see attached).

This would mean at least a small portion of the moon is not completely
darkened, which, to me, means this is not a total lunar eclipse. Am I
incorrect in this understanding?

I realize Stellarium does not use CSPICE for computations, but I ran
the computations with CSPICE and got a similar result. My computations
assume the Earth is spherical, but I use the equatorial radius, which
should overestimate a total eclipse, not underestimate it.

Even the diagram at
https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCLEmap/2001-2100/LE2021-05-26T.gif
(and in
https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEplot/LEplot2001/LE2021May26T.pdf) show
that it's a very close call at best.

Appreciate your help as always!

Hi Barry,

I don't have an explanation, but I think the answer has to do
with how eclipses are defined.

A clue might be found here:

   https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OHres/LEshadow.html

If you perform your computation with the "enlarged Earth," does
the Moon then fall into the umbral shadow?

The fact that "blood Moon eclipses" occur seems to show that sunlight
reaching the Moon due to refraction apparently is not considered
to violate the "total eclipse" condition.

A separate note: it would be possible for the Moon to be partially
illuminated, but for the illuminated part to be invisible to an
observer at a specific point on the Earth's surface, since that
observer can only see the cap of the Moon inside the limb. That observer
would see a "total" eclipse, even though the Moon was not contained
in the Earth's umbral shadow.

Best regards,

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Hi Barry,

You can find times of eclipses as seen from a point on the Earth's
surface if you treat that point as an ephemeris object. This is done
by making an SPK file that provides the position (and optionally,
constant Cartesian velocity) of the point. The tool for creating
such an SPK file is called PINPOINT. You can obtain the executable
for your platform and user's guide here:

   https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/utilities.html

You could lay out a grid of points on a region of interest and
compute eclipse times for all of them. (Clunky, but effective.)
You could use the SPICE utility SPKMERGE to create a single
SPK file containing data for all of your surface points.

Alternatively, you might find it more convenient to write your
own, small version of PINPOINT by using the SPK type 8 writer
function

   spkw08_c

I'm looking at the code example in the N0066 version of this function,
and it's not very good. I've included below the example text of the N0067
update.

In your case, you'd call spkw08_c once per surface point. Each
point would need just two identical states to define its ephemeris:
one each at the ephemeris start and stop times.

The "Making an SPK" tutorial might be helpful. It's here:

   https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/tutorials.html

You might also find the function

   occult_c

of interest. This function simply computes an occultation state at
a given time.

As you've probably noticed, SPICE computations involving light
assume that light travels in straight lines. So, modeling refraction,
gravitational light bending, and any other optical effects is up
to the user.

SPICE doesn't offer any more sophisticated APIs for eclipse
computations.
