Subject: Can gfoclt() find eclipses on the surfaces of bodies?

*****NAME OF GUY********,

Thanks again for all of your previous help with CSPICE.

While reading the documentation examples for gfoclt_c() at
https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/gfoclt_c.html#Examples
I noticed that it says:

"Find occultations of the Sun by the Moon (that is, solar eclipses) as
seen from the *center* of the Earth over the month December, 2001"
[emphasis added]

However, just to clarify, this function won't necessarily find
eclipses on the *surface* of the Earth, is that correct?

I noticed that both the back body and the front body can be modelled
as triaxial ellipsoids, but the target must be a single point.

Is there a better way to find eclipses on the surface of bodies,
instead of at a central point?

I tried writing a penUmbralData() function that does this:

https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/master/ASTRO/bclib.h#L728

but it only works if all three bodies are spherical (I also realize
this should be bclib.c not bclib.h), and it's not super accurate.

Subject: Is lunar eclipse of 26 May 2021 really total?

[[[ATTACH!!!!]]]

********NAME*******,

While trying to write a function that computes eclipses on surfaces of
bodies, I ran into an unusual situation: it appears that the lunar
eclipse of 26 May 2021 is not quite total, unless I'm misunderstanding
the definition of total eclipse.

More specifically, if you're at the lunar north pole at the time of
greatest eclipse (2021-05-26 11:18:04.3 UTC), a small portion of the
Sun is still visible, at least according to Stellarium (see attached).

This would mean at least a small portion of the moon is not completely
darkened, which, to me, means this is not a total lunar eclipse. Am I
incorrect in this understanding?

I realize Stellarium does not use CSPICE for computations, but I ran
the computations with CSPICE and got a similar result. My computations
assume the Earth is spherical, but I use the equatorial radius, which
should overestimate a total eclipse, not underestimate it.

Even the diagram at
https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCLEmap/2001-2100/LE2021-05-26T.gif
(and in
https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEplot/LEplot2001/LE2021May26T.pdf) show
that it's a very close call at best.

Appreciate your help as always!

Hi Barry,

I don't have an explanation, but I think the answer has to do
with how eclipses are defined.

A clue might be found here:

   https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OHres/LEshadow.html

If you perform your computation with the "enlarged Earth," does
the Moon then fall into the umbral shadow?

The fact that "blood Moon eclipses" occur seems to show that sunlight
reaching the Moon due to refraction apparently is not considered
to violate the "total eclipse" condition.

A separate note: it would be possible for the Moon to be partially
illuminated, but for the illuminated part to be invisible to an
observer at a specific point on the Earth's surface, since that
observer can only see the cap of the Moon inside the limb. That observer
would see a "total" eclipse, even though the Moon was not contained
in the Earth's umbral shadow.

Best regards,

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Hi Barry,

You can find times of eclipses as seen from a point on the Earth's
surface if you treat that point as an ephemeris object. This is done
by making an SPK file that provides the position (and optionally,
constant Cartesian velocity) of the point. The tool for creating
such an SPK file is called PINPOINT. You can obtain the executable
for your platform and user's guide here:

   https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/utilities.html

You could lay out a grid of points on a region of interest and
compute eclipse times for all of them. (Clunky, but effective.)
You could use the SPICE utility SPKMERGE to create a single
SPK file containing data for all of your surface points.

Alternatively, you might find it more convenient to write your
own, small version of PINPOINT by using the SPK type 8 writer
function

   spkw08_c

I'm looking at the code example in the N0066 version of this function,
and it's not very good. I've included below the example text of the N0067
update.

In your case, you'd call spkw08_c once per surface point. Each
point would need just two identical states to define its ephemeris:
one each at the ephemeris start and stop times.

The "Making an SPK" tutorial might be helpful. It's here:

   https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/tutorials.html

You might also find the function

   occult_c

of interest. This function simply computes an occultation state at
a given time.

As you've probably noticed, SPICE computations involving light
assume that light travels in straight lines. So, modeling refraction,
gravitational light bending, and any other optical effects is up
to the user.

SPICE doesn't offer any more sophisticated APIs for eclipse
computations.
