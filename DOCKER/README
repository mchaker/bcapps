Experiments with Docker. Goal: create a CSPICE image

# this does not work, centos quits instantly
# sudo docker run -dP centos

# this does work

sudo docker run -it -d centos

# run /bin/bash on it in other window/screen

sudo docker exec -it inspiring_leakey /bin/bash

# TODO: later did this in the gcc docker

# TODO: remove: tar file, tcsh (required for compilation), o files

# remove test000 dir
