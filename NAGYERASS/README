This is "nagyerass take two", a replacement for nagios, after I've
used nagios for a while and understand what I dislike about it.

bc-run-nya-test.pl: This program will do the following:

  - log that a test is about to be run

  - run a test that is either a raw Unix command (including possibly a
  test that's part of the nagios suite) or a subroutine found in
  bc-run-nya-test.pl itself

  - a test may contain subtests, which will be run as separate forked processes

  - log the results of the test

  - print to ~/ERR the results of the test

TODO: make it an error for test results to be too old

TODO: maybe create second file from metafile (in private location) to
handle $$ cleanly

TODO: test may contain subtests

TODO: include private tests

TODO: import existing nagios tests

TODO: add ping tests since I don't have the concept of hosts vs services

TODO: allow suppress.txt to suppress running tests, not just printing results

TODO: consider moving inventory checks here?

TODO: test that weather data is fairly recent

TODO: test that drives are mounted correctly: ie, /mnt/villa and
/mnt/lobos are mounting the correct drives-- do NOT use
/mnt/villa/villa-files.txt as a test since I long term plan to copy
file lists to multiple drives (maybe use blkid and program I wrote?)

TODO: if qbittorrent is running there should be a process waiting for
it to "end" since I need to know if it crashes

TODO: check recent changes to calendar.txt to see if I mention 2018 or
otherwise add a date that seems unreasonable

TODO: confirm all doordash receipts have a link to the receipt (ie, a
receipt number) and there are no duplicate receipt numbers (and maybe
that receipt numbers are in numerical order by date)

TODO: make sure claim numbers in medical database are unique (and in
order of date?)

TODO: alert if my Ally bank balance falls below $15K, where Ally gives
me a much lower interest rate

TODO: don't run tests if CPU it too low

TODO: getmail log recency (existing perl script)

TODO: fix-it scripts when something goes wrong

TODO: REMINDER: can write tests even before nagyerass goes into production
