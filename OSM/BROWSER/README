Docker Instructions
===================

Do "ruby bc-osm-browser.rb" in the /root/ directory to start the program.

NOTE: I'm distributing the code using docker because it *requires* an
older version of Ruby that most people will not have.

TODO: graphics commands create but don't show

Contributing
============

Please don't edit the docker image; instead, use git/github:

(or contact me, Barry Carter, osmbrowse@barrycarter.info, directly)

History
=======

In December 2007, I cowrote a Perl program to text browse OpenStreetMap.

We later converted the Perl to Ruby in early 2008.

The Ruby version works with "ruby 2.0.0p648 (2015-12-16)", but not
with any Ruby versions after that. See "Overriding and overloading
Ruby functions is bad" in TODO for why.

Additionally, the Ruby version misuses object oriented programming
horribly (see "Storing user information in map objects is bad" in the
TODO file for why.

The program was always intended to be open source, but we never got it
cleaned up enough to share it.

This is mostly the ugly Ruby version as is, with a few notes and minor
changes. The other people who cowrote the program are OK with my
releasing this to open source, but did not wish to be associated with
this code (that's how bad it is!), so I have removed their information
and am not mentioning it here.

I am hoping to massively improve it with others, as noted in the TODO list.

Notes
=====

All latitudes/longitudes are in decimal degree format

The "short form" of an object is what's displayed in a list, the "long
form" is displayed when a user uses "examine"

TODO: create separate TODO file

TODO: graphics commands won't work in docker, but...

TODO: LC_ALL can NOT be blank or "C" but docker handles this
