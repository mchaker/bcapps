I am not famous: there are many famous people named Barry Carter
(including a poker book writer, someone involved with something called
ORMUS, a Middle East reporter and probably others). I am not any of
these.

Contact Information:

The fastest way to reach me is Google Talk/Hangouts via my email
address "carter.barry@gmail.com". Of course, you can also email that
address directly, but that is slower

StackExchange profile:

I'm bored a lot of the time and willing to help people for free.

If you need help, or want a clarification on a question I've answered
or commented on, please google talk me at carter.barry@gmail.com
... of course, you can also use SE's own comment/answer features or
email me, but google talk is fastest.

You can also google talk me if you have a math/science question
unrelated to SE.

TODO: add other contact infos that I use less often?
