MAP SERVER
==========

Notes for map server:

  - Request not in JSON, advise them to send "{cmd: 'help'}"

  - help should include sources and limitations

  - should listen on UDS and client programs can provide web/socket service

Data provided:

  - Elevation (SRTM 3 second + alt source for high alt) (maybe SRTM 1)

  - Climate (Koeppen-Geiger)

  - Astronomical phenomena (computed)

  - Land slope

  - Land use (ESACCI)

  - TODO: population density?

  - TODO: timezone

  - TODO: nation/state/etc?

What I have:

  - 200G server on digitalocean

  - binary versions of elevation, climate, land slope and land use
  (but need help combining them)

  - program that computes astronomical phenomena

Data sources and information:

  - http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/srtmdata/

Help I need w/ map server:

  - Converting front end JS requests to back end file byte requests

  - Gluing large bin files together

  - Returning data consistently and quasi-efficiently

  - Testing accuracy

Basic commands:

  - cmd=(climate|landuse|elevation) lats=, latn=, lonw=, lone= : obtain data for a given bounding box

  - cmd=source data=(climate|landuse|elevation): data source information

  - cmd=key data=(climate|landuse|elevation): the key to convert returned values to meaningful values

  - cmd=meta data=(climate|landuse|elevation): metadata about the various data types (TODO: this may need to be split into sources)

Notes:

  - The GMTED2010 files for far north and far south regions DO exist
  as ZIP files on earthexplorer.usgs.gov, but you have to request them
  as a special case by choosing points or lines within those areas.

  - `gdalinfo 70n120w_20101117_gmted_max075.tif` shows gdal does
  recognize the TIFs I mention above (the rest of the data is in ADF
  format)

OLD STUFF
=========

Mercator maps are normally drawn with the North Pole at top, Equator
in the middle and South Pole at the bottom.

This project aims to use proj4 and openstreetmap.org and convert's
"convert -distort Perspective" to create Mercator (and other
projection) maps with arbitrary north/south poles and direction.

This isn't trivial even for static maps, since the slippy tile level
you have to use varies with position. If you put a large city at the
north pole, for example, you will need more detail in that area, since
Mercator maps use more area near the poles.

Ultimate goal is to create a map that overlays google maps with any
given projection and parameters. This means find and computing the
reshaped slippy tiles in real time.
