Mercator maps are normally drawn with the North Pole at top, Equator
in the middle and South Pole at the bottom.

This project aims to use proj4 and openstreetmap.org and convert's
"convert -distort Perspective" to create Mercator (and other
projection) maps with arbitrary north/south poles and direction.

This isn't trivial even for static maps, since the slippy tile level
you have to use varies with position. If you put a large city at the
north pole, for example, you will need more detail in that area, since
Mercator maps use more area near the poles.

Ultimate goal is to create a map that overlays google maps with any
given projection and parameters. This means find and computing the
reshaped slippy tiles in real time.

Notes for map server:

  - Request not in JSON, advise them to send "{cmd: 'help'}"

  - help should include sources and limitations

Data provided:

  - Elevation (SRTM 3 second + alt source for high alt)

  - Climate (Koeppen-Geiger)

  - Astronomical phenomena (computed)

  - Land slope

  - Land use (ESACCI)

What I have:

  - 200G server on digitalocean

  - binary versions of elevation, climate, land slope and land use
  (but need help combining them)

  - program that computes astronomical phenomena


Help I need w/ map server:

  - Converting front end JS requests to back end file byte requests

  - Gluing large bin files together

  - Returning data consistently and quasi-efficiently

  - Testing accuracy
